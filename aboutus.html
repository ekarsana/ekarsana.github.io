She realized the need for legal consultation within the Indonesian American community, especially those for applyiny for Political Asylum in 1998 when the Jakarta riot erupted. We’ve been helping minorities such as Indonesian Chinese and/or Christian victims and their families in hopes to protect them from persecution and violence. When it started in 1998, we partnered with Thomas Prince, Esq and have openned a branch of The Law Office of Thomas Prince in Arcadia, CA. We have been running strong ever since. By the Grace of God, our Insurance and Legal Services Provider Business has flourished until now and we’ve been known in the Indonesian American community for over 25 years. Early this Year, after 20 years of service, Thomas Prince retired and is no longer accepting any new clients, however we are currently working with Peter Hong, Stephen Perisho and Jed Leano, three attorneys eager to help the Indonesian Community. Jed will be handling immigration and Peter Hong will be handling the rest of the legal services. Thank you for reading our story and we hope we make an impact on yours.</p>
